It is a Survival Prediction model, it is used to predict wether a person will be able to survive from a sinking ship or not.


Here I have used Logistic Regression to predict.


I Have manually implemented the logistic regression.


Then I have compared the value of final prediction using my manually implemented Logistic regression and Logistic Regression imported from sklean.


Manually implemented model was found to have a similar accuracy to that of the Sklean.
